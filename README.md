# Kernel Matrix Analysis with Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction

## Project Description  
This project demonstrates the use of kernel matrices to analyze complex datasets by applying clustering algorithms and dimensionality reduction techniques. It leverages methods like t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) and Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) to reveal hidden patterns and relationships within the data. The combination of these approaches helps visualize data structure in lower-dimensional spaces for better understanding and interpretation.

## Features  
- Construction and analysis of kernel matrices  
- Implementation of clustering algorithms for data grouping  
- Application of dimensionality reduction techniques including t-SNE and MDS  
- Visualization of clustering results and reduced dimensional data
