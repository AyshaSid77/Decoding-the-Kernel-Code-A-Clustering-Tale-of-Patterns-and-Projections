# Decoding-the-Kernel-Code-A-Clustering-Tale-of-Patterns-and-Projections
This project explores kernel matrices using clustering algorithms and dimensionality reduction techniques such as t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) and Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) to uncover hidden patterns, structures, and similarities in complex datasets.
